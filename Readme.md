A contract that collects receipts with the total amount from payments of 2 or more participants, works out the balances, splits value owed per participant and sends out the balance owed to each participant.

Use case: 4 friends go on a week end trip 2 of them pay for 3 dinners, 1 pays for accommodation, 1 pays for the car, 3 pay for 3 supermarket shops. After they all input their amounts to the smart contract (in eth) and it works out who owes who.

Instead of paying it off or balancing between all straight away, present further options to:
- Invest the balance to somewhere
- Convert to something
- Keep the balance for the next group gathering
- Create own Token
- Create little bets/games eg. double or nothing
- Chat
- Push notifications
- Set group photo
- Picture of receipt
